# Changelog

## v1.0 - 2024-06-29

Initial release of the specification based on my fork
of [Spring Pet Clinic](https://github.com/skanjo/spring-petclinic). Includes basic use cases and wireframes. This will
serve as the basis for evolving the app into something more useful as a pet clinic rather than serving as a reference
for how to build a basic web application using Spring. This spec can be used to develop the application using any
languages, frameworks, and libraries.
